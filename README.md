# Elevator-System

* Contained in the folder `Elevator_System`
* This is the Capstone Project of this C++ program. It gives a chance to practice the knowledge of C++ programming language, by implementing the well-know Object-Oreiented Design (OOD) problem, Elevator System Design. Within this project:
    * Implemented single elevator system, with functions to handle `ExternalRequest` and `InternalRequest`, which are from specific floor the user wants to take the elevator, and the requests to specific floor when the user is inside the elevator, respectively
    * According to the requirement of the course project, several important topics within this C++  has been adopted:
        * **Loops, Functions, I/O**
        * **Object Oriented Programming**
        * **Memory Management**
